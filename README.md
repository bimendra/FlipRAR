## About This Project
As a **.NET Web API developer**, I wanted to explore **Windows desktop app development** using **WPF**.  
This project served as a small experiment to understand:
- WPF layouts (`Grid`, `StackPanel`, `ScrollViewer`).
- Image display and scaling in desktop apps.
- Interaction between UI elements and code-behind.
- Event-driven programming in WPF.

---

## Requirements
- .NET 6.0 or later  
- Visual Studio 2022 (or compatible)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlipRAR.git

## Future Improvements
- Fit-to-width zoom for page display.
